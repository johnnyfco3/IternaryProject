Hello Professor,

The short description of my project can be found in the README.md file. In this file, I also included the command
to run the application.

The pages to my project can be found under the src folder, Pages and Components folder. The styling of this 
application is all in one file named App.css

I have chosen to use bootstrap to help with the style. The imports of bootstrap and font awesome can be found in
the public folder, index.html file.

Thank you,
Johnny
