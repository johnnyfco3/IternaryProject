# Short Description of project

For this project, I have chosen to build a social media application that focuses on traveling. This application will allow users to create an account, add adventures/posts to their pages, and view other people's pages. The difference between this application and applications like instagram or facebook is that this application will not allow users to like, comment or share other people's posts/adventures. It is intended to only display their own experiences. Also there will not a functionality to "follow" other users. The way users will be able to view other people's pages will be through the input of the other person's email. This allows the application to be more of a personal application rather than public.
